# 300 Artifactory Cloud

The easiest way is with an [Artifactory Cloud](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/versions/#Cloud) account. 

In this mode, since Artifactory is a hosted service, you do not need to set up a reverse proxy and can create your Docker repositories and start pushing and pulling Docker images.
